# Git and Github tutorial for the team

## Setting up 


`$ git init` 
creates a .git folder

`$ ls -la`
to see all files and folders (including hidden) 

`$ git add .`

`$ git commit -m "commit title" -m "commit description"`
this is only local

`$ git branch -M main`

`$ git remote add origin https://github.com/AhmedAGadir/git_session_prototype.git`
allows us to connect to a remote location online

`$ git push -u origin main`
-u stands for upstream and it just sets up a shortcut for `git push`



## Making changes

`$ git diff`
to see differences between your current project and your last commit 

`$ git diff branch_name`
to see difference between your branch and another branch
