==== WHAT IS GIT AND GITHUB ====

- get everyone to clone the repo

- explain the .git folder and the difference between git and github


==== BASIC BRANCH AND MERGING =======

explain what a branch is and why you might use one

git checkout -b feature-more-html

git branch

+ <p>world</p>

git diff

git add .
git commit -m 'added world'

git diff main (you can see the changes)

git push (explain)

then go to github and finish the pull request

come back and delete the 

git checkout main
git branch -d feature-more-html


==== MERGE CONFLICTS ====

git checkout -b feature-making-a-conflict

+ line 3: <p>the weather is great today</p>

git commit -am "spoke about the great weather"
git push

git checkout main

+ line 3: <p>the weather is absolute garbage today</p>

git commit -am "spoke about the garbage weather"
git push

git branch
git diff feature-making-a-conflict

speak about how you want to merge main into your branch before your pull request. 
as you work on bugs, features, its likely that the repos changed, so you want to make your pull request up to date when you do it.

git checkout feature-making-a-conflict
git merge main

solve the merge conflict on the IDE

git commit -am "fixed weather merge conflict"
git push

finish the pull request on github

switch into main branch and delete the branch we no longer need
